**Thesis Abstract**

East Africa is one of the main centres of species diversity within *Kalanchoë*, an important genus for maintaining ecosystem functioning in dry environments. Many species of *Kalanchoë* are also known for their ethnobotanical value, including for medicinal and ornamental use. However, little is known about the phylogenetic relationship among the species, as well as the ethnobotanical value of the genus in the region. The presented phylogenetic study included about 30% of all *Kalanchoë* species within the genus, whereof about half of the species native to continental Africa, and nearly 70 % of the native East African species. The study provides the first phylogeny of *Kalanchoë* estimated from nuclear regions using the universal Angiosperm 353 bait panel, as well as the first comprehensive ethnobotanical survey on the use of the genus in East Africa. The reconstructed phylogeny shows that East Africa hosts species of *Kalanchoë* with a high molecular diversity as they resolve in many different subclades, while the ethnobotanical findings are that the genus is a valuable medicinal plant in the region with widespread uses, predominantly used to treat a wide range of infections, inflammatory conditions, and to relieve pain. Nearly half of occurring species have known use, whereof the species K. densiflora was the most utilized with 40 % of all retrieved use-records. The findings make an important foundation for conservation, management, and further research on the genus.

**Here are a couple of small Data Analysis Projects I have done for fun:**

### Global Air Pollution (WHO)

**Goal:** Explore the WHO's Global Air Pollution Data to create an overview of its sources, the concentrations of pollutants, timelines and trends, and the regions/cities most affected by pollutants. 
  
**Skills:** Python, Data Preparation, Data Analysis, Visualizations (Including timelines, combined horizontal barplot, histograms, boxplots. correlation matrix).  
#### See project and code: [Global Air Pollution code, visualizations and insights](https://github.com/ToriiX/AirPollutionEDA/blob/main/WHO_global_air_pollution.ipynb)

### IUCN Red List of Threatened Species

**Goal:** To investigate the overall comprehensiveness of the Red List, and if there are considerations that need to be taken if using the list as a guideline for wildlife conservation actions and measures.

**Skills:** Python, Data Preparation and Manipulation, Data Analysis including Correlation Analysis, Customized Data Visualization.

### Iris Dataset

**Goal:** Explore species feature variation within (intra) and between (inter) three species of Iris found in North America. The results can be used for species classification and further development of Machine Learning models for classification.

**Skills:** Python, Data Preparation, Data Analysis, Correlation Matrices, and various Visualizations (including heatmap, violin plot, bar plots, boxplots, KDE plot) and PCA.
